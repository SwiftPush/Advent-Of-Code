# Advent of Code - 2017
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles. I've decided to learn a new programming language, Rust, for these puzzles.

## Building
To install rust on MacOSX:
```
brew install rust
```

To build any of the solutions, run:
```
cargo run
```

To run the unit tests, run:
```
cargo test
```
